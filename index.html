        <h3 style="font-size:20px;text-shadow: 2px 2px red;">Background</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="textbody">
        <p>My name is Mat Connell, I’m generation x somewhere in the vicinity of 40 years old. I have a beautiful wife, Lucy, two amazing young boys - Felix (4), Charlie (2) and an Australian Bulldog named Rupert.</p>

<p>I live in a small rural community Northeast of Canberra where my place of employment is situated. The drive isn’t substantial and the benefits of owning and living on some acreage outside any metropolitan precinct is well worth the commute.</p>

<p>Growing up in a small country town located in the North East of Victoria (Mount Beauty). I was afforded the benefit of an Australian country upbringing/lifestyle and I gravitated back to something as similar as I could manage when opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>I’m currently employed by an Australian Government Agency, working in a Specialist Operations team. My historical vocational background includes military, tactical, technical and covert operations - Covering disciplines as diverse as electronic engineering to espionage.</p>

<p>I’ve been in this particular industry now, for approximately 20 years. Travelling and working in numerous foreign countries, whilst also operating extensively domestically as well.</p>

<p> interests and hobbies include most sports, particularly basketball and AFL football. Unfortunately, due to numerous injuries, sustained both vocationally and in my sporting pursuits, I now limit myself to my other passions, long range shooting, fishing, golf, and beer brewing.</p>

<p>My wife and I also own a small Pub in my town of origin - <a href="https://www.westpeakhotel.com.au"target="_blank">The West Peak Hotel</a> - So named from the Westerly facing aspect of Mt Bogong, which is situated on our doorstep.  We own the business in partnership with my two cousins and their families.</p>

<p>Purchasing the land and exsisting freehold in 2017, we set about completley renovating the interior, and re-establishing a community asset which had gone into liquidation years before.</p>

<p>Further, we are currently in the process of, establishing a micro-brewery, on location in the Pub. The brewery is/will be called Mountain Monk Breweries. This hobby and business development is also linked to my project, outlined in this assessment documentation. </p>

      <h3 style="font-size:20px;text-shadow: 2px 2px red;">Interest in IT</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="textbody">

         <p>I’ll deviate slightly here from a mundane response i.e. societal technical evolution, keeping up with the Jones’s and such. My intrigue in the IT industry, although similar in context, stems more from my vocation and the advancement in my technological aptitude derived from career progression and the evolution of said industry.</p>

<p>These basic factors form the foundation for my interest but being such a vast and complex domain, this can be an extremely difficult question to answer.</p>

<p>My entry into this field originates from an electronic engineering/hardware-based background. Personal and vocational development has given me the desire to expand on my existing knowledge base and educate myself in the many other spheres of the IT industry - In particular, software-based application and development.</p>

<p>In modern industry, technological innovation/advancement is rapidly accelerating. This is a highly motivating factor for me personally and professionally. To stay ahead or even maintain parity demands you progress, or you’re left behind, and I find this a unique and intoxicating environment.</p>

<p>My current occupation makes it extremely difficult for me to specifically detail my exact role, but it was my interest in IT which has provided me the pathway to where I am today.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
         <p>I purposely chose to study a degree in IT, opposed to a more specifically tailored undergraduate programme. This was primarily due to the broader spectrum of topics and disciples available to learn. This area of study will compliment my current qualifications and provide me with the best solution moving forward.</p>

        <h2>Catalyst event?</h2>
					<p>I think working in an area which is on the cutting edge of technology and has access to a vast amount of resources, its relatively easy to witness the evolution of many facets in the IT industry, You need to be constantly evolving as an organisation and as an individual I you want to succeed in this domain.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
					<p>
- Electronics (Comms/Hardware)<br>

- Basic level programming (Python, Linux) <br>

- Networking <br>

- Security <br>

- System architecture <br>

- Alarm systems <br>

- Raspberry Pi / Arduino’s <br>

- IoT devices </p>

				<h2>Why OUA?</h2>
					<p> I decided to study through OUA & RMIT, solely because of the anonymity and flexibility that online learning affords me. Working fulltime in a clandestine environment was also a highly influential reason I selected an online avenue of study.</p>

        <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
          <p>
- QS 5 star rating  <br>

- A solid understanding of current industry practices  <br>

- Education specialising in practical, industry-based learning. <br>

- Partnerships with leading international companies and organisations  </p>

          <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>My expectations entail – building and edifying my current skills and knowledge. Commence filling in the multitude of holes in my current education. Cultivating some of IT’s fundamental concepts and core doctrine, assisting in my personal and vocational development.</p>
