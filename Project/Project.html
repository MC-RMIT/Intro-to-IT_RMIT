<p>There are many ways to control the different steps in the brewing process. There is definitely an art which directly correlates with the science to control the brewing process.<br>
<br>
My conceptualisation involves the control function and processes for small microbreweries/pilot plant constructions. <br>
<br>
Utilising a Raspberry Pi for software application and the primary control module, whilst incorporating a series of Arduino’s for mechanical control functionality, which can also be controlled independently from the main control unit. <br>
<br>
Conceptually building a small-scale brewing control system that will have the ability to run semi-autonomously and provide control and monitoring remotely. </p>

<p>As I alluded to in my personal background section, my project idea relates to a current business endeavour of mine – A Micro Brewery, which will be constructed and run onsite through my Pub, the West Peak Hotel. <br>
<br>
Specifically, my idea revolves in the technical element to the art of beer brewing. Currently hardware and software packages generally cater for large corporation style breweries, providing semi-automated systems, but still require a large amount of staff to control the process. This isn’t including the staff also required to maintain any of the mundane operation of the brewery either. <br>
<br>
Craft brewers, according to the Brewers Association, are small, independent and traditional. They must meet requirements including less than 25% ownership by a large corporation or bigger brewer, and they must qualify for the Tax and Trade Bureau's excise tax differential by producing less than two million barrels annually.<br>
<br>
Craft brewers are artisans and lovers of beer first and foremost. But craft brewing is also a manufacturing business with the attendant issues, such as expansion, quality, manufacturability and optimisation.  <br>
<br>
Falling well into the “Artisan” category we can’t fiscally commit to building a brand-new facility, with any of the high-end control systems and equipment required to properly take advantage of such a conceptually sound system. <br>
<br>
Although scalable systems are on offer, these often require specifically fabricated mashing and fermenting systems. <br>
<br>
According to a Deloitte statistical report - The production of craft beer in Australia has evolved from a small industry comprised of home-brew enthusiasts, to a large and rapidly growing industry with annual sales in excess of $370 million, growing at a rate of around 10% per year. Sales of craft beer represent an estimated 5%, and growing, of the total sales in the Australian beer market.

<p>Detailed description of the features of the product or service</p>

<p>Designing and constructing a modular control system that offers us the flexibility to remotely monitor and control the multitude processes required to brew a decent beer, will be invaluable to our business. <br>
<br>
Currently the 3 directors (myself and my two cousins) all work and reside in geographically different locations from the proposed microbrewery site. Brewing can be a simple process, but it can also become extremely complicated when trying to design a craft beer that will compete in the ever-increasing craft beer market.<br>
<br>
The envisage the system to operate, manage, measure and test during several the phases in the brewing process. Functionality would include: <br>
<br>
- Recipe system - Hosting a modifiable recipe database and software integration with some current 3rd party web-based brewing sites.
<br>
******* Hierarchical recipe system
<br>
Batch control centre software
<br>
******* Ingredient profiles
<br>
******* Gravity testing (Alcohol measurement)
<br>
******* Fermentable tables
<br>
******* Yeast characteristics
<br>
- Batch control - Fermenter control measures
<br>
******* Temperature profiling
<br>
******* wort control.
<br>
******* Water testing and ph. monitoring.
<br>
******* Nutrient testing and deficiency identification
<br>
******* Volume management
<br>
- Mechanical application and industrial vat/fermenter plumbing control
<br>
- Separation Procedures/Formulas
<br>
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi functionality to remote measurement and control instruments
<br>
- Alerts (text / email) remote software access
<br>
- Ingredient phase control
<br>
 Although there will always be a physical/manual labour requirement in the process. Having the ability to remotely monitor and control the brewing process, in particular the fermentation process where adjustments are often required on a daily basis.  <br>
<br>
Temperature control and wort chemical/nutrient balance is a priority during this phase and managing to monitor these elements will not only be a game changer for us personally, given our remote locality, but this may have some feasible application to any small scale brewers who can’t afford anything like the SIMATIC PCS 7 BOX ( Approx. $16k AU) and wish to analytically and systematically control their brewing process, maintaining the ability to keep the essence of the beer craft artisan profiling, which is currently so popular. </p>

<p>Equipment / Hardware / Software</p>
<p>I'm not including any of a generic brewing system including electronic/mechanical sub systems and componentry, just the IT componentry required to facilitate my design. <br>
<br>
Hardware:
<br>
- Raspberry Pi
<br>
- Arduino’s
<br>
- Affiliated modules
<br>
Software:
<br>
- Will primarily require personal software development and
<br>
- Open source investigation.
<br>
- Possible 3rd party programming assistance
<br>
- Software integration
<br>
I don’t envisage the software development to be overly complicated as there is a fair amount of open source help available and the system architecture in essence, is rather simplistic. <br>
<br>
3rd party assistance may be required when integrating certain componentry like current of the shelf measurement devices and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi compatibility. <br>
<br>
My strengths are in hardware management, electronic/mechanical system design and construction. There may be some requirement to design and route specific PCB’s but this will be a phased process and I will endeavour to design around software application initially, giving me the required framework to complete this process.  </p>

     <h2 style="font-size:30px;text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px green">Outcome</h2>

<p>Ultimate success can be measured in control and application for my business which hopefully translates to a fiscal saving and increased profit margin through process. <br>
<br>
Concept trademark and sale would also constitute a massive success, but this is ancillary to my ultimate goal which is feasible systematic process control, remote monitoring/management and functional variable measurement.<br>
<br>
Ideally I design a real life working model over the coming years and develop a system that provides us access to brew a better beer.
