<p>The skills for a DO position can significantly vary given they generally require a broad understanding of tools and technologies. Some core requirements for the outlined position constitute; coding/programming (Linux (CentOS/RHEL), Docker implementation and support and the development of technical documentation.<br>
      <br>
More generically affiliated skills can include: Source control, Continuous integration, Cloud technology, Testing, Infrastructure automation, orchestration and container concepts.<br>
<br>
In particular, DO requires people with excellent communications skills, understand their work environments - including people, culture and workplace diversity. DO primarily provide a bridge between the different areas in an organisation and hence become the conduit to a successfully run program.<br>
<br>
The DO is a dynamic role, rewarding those who have a passion for progression and want to continually evolve. Problem solving, analytical and tangential process are elements ae the reasons a position like this would appeal to me.</p>

       <p>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</p>
       <p>In relation to working in DO, I currently possess a decent array of technical skills and experience that would equate well in certain organisations, but not in all. With my last 8 years working in a covert technical branch, I’ve developed experience and qualifications that correlate well to DO particularly in hardware and internal infra- structure, but I would require much more software development training to fulfil the role confidently.<br>
         <br>
My interpersonal skills and teamwork/team management are excellent, and I have the requisite resume to facilitate this requirement in this role scope. Soft skills are developed and cultured throughout a career, but you also need to have the capacity to fulfil these responsibilities.<br>
<br>
Undertaking the IT degree will re-enforce my current knowledge base and provide the foundation for the future hard skills, I will require to successfully attain a position in DO.<br>
<br>
Further, the DO role I’ve outlined in this assessment requires TSPV security clearance, which is extremely difficult to attain if you’ve never worked in highly sensitive areas. I currently possess the required security level in this instance and is a major draw card for companies who require this f the prospective employees. </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:30px;text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px blue">The Plan</h2>

<p>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. </p>
<p>As I stated earlier, my plan moving forward, constitutes a research and development role in my current industry. If I was to roadmap something for the DO role, I'll be shooting from the hip on this.<br>
<br>
Apart from the obvious (complete an IT degree) I would be looking at specifically targeting a few core components which will transition well to any DO position.<br>
<br>
Programming – Python/Linux, are the two languages I would focus on and are two skills I've already begun to work on. Although I’m only in my infancy in this education, these are core building blocks for any software engineer/developer.<br>
<br>
VMWare – Hyper-V etc. And cloud infrastructure. A modern approach to any industry and will be the operating norm in the coming years, if not already.<br>
<br>
Security - Combining development and operations is a great way to streamline development and deployment of code, the faster cycle means vulnerabilities can be more readily introduced into code. DO engineers must have the skills to write secure code, to protect applications at the same time defend against common cybersecurity vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
To facilitate this plan, I will be completing some free online training tools such as Code academy and Over the wire, concentrating on building a solid foundation before enrolling in some specific VET and other Nationally accredited training courses.  </p>
