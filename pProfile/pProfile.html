<p>Advocate (Assertive)</p>

<p>With phrases such as: inborn sense of idealism and morality, capable of taking concrete steps to realise their goals and make a lasting positive impact. One can see why this is a unique profile (1% of the population).</p>

<p>I feel in essence, sentiments like this are grandiose, but I believe I do relate to a fair few of the outlined traits in this sub-category.</p>

<p>A few examples in areas where I differ slightly to their perceived traits for an Advocate:

Advocates find it easy to make connections with others – I think I can relate to others well, but this is different to making a connection.</p>

<p>Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas to Advocate personalities. - Whilst this is true for me, the formative example; “These types tend to believe that nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants”. Is an overly simplistic and somewhat illogical argument.  Personally, I am more of a realist than an idealist.</p>

<p>Summation of Advocate in relevance to group work on our course</p>


<p>- A few traits that I definitively relate to:<br>

- Private (closed book)<br>

- Don’t readily communicate feelings<br>

- Requires patience from others to get to know an advocate<br>

- Avoid most social situations<br>

- Demands integrity and honesty<br>

- Thinks outside the box (productive but works on different tangents to the norm).</p>

<p>These introverted traits can make it extremely difficult for myself and my team-mates in relation to communication. I will always stay in the shadows and this may frustrate some other personalirty types.</p>

<p>In my professional sphere, this characteristic is referred to as the ‘grey man’. In saying this I will always play my role, providing valuable and creative input. My innate drive to work hard and desire to see my team succeed, will always override any negative’s stemming from my reluctance to be more than a voice in the background. </p>

  <p>Overview</p>
  <p>It’s an interesting concept and it does reflect many of my inherent traits but at the same time it also missed the mark in some areas.</p>
  <p>For me personally, the results did establish some interesting internal reflection, focusing on my strengths and weaknesses characteristic to my attributed profile.</p>
  <p>The learning style test was an accurate assessment of how I envisage myself against the exercise parameters. I'd even say the 2 primary attributes, evenly split (37.2% each) between the Theorist and Reflection attributes was a good indication of how I see myself in this particular test.</p>
  <p>Of course, inconclusive results are expected given any limited psychoanalysis, but it does provide any possible employer a metric into my personality profile and a scope in relation to how I would fit into their existing working environment.</p>
  <p>To be honest, I found the other tests I undertook a little more whimsical and they didn’t really establish anything that a prospective employer would find of value. The results seemed to constitute a broader spectrum of parametersand a less concise dialogue pertaining to the specified results.</p>

 <p>Composition</p>
 <p>I'm not sure how much relevance they will have with me personally, but they did re-enforce some character traits I already attribute to my everyday working life and I would continue to display in any future vocation.</p>

 <p>During my career I’ve undertaken much more rigorous psychometric and psychological profiling, and nothing was identified here that hasn’t already been identified or action taken to rectify if considered a fault.</p>

<p>To be more specific and to answer in relation to this degree. I’m quietly confident in my abilities and I tend to hold back until I need to present my viewpoint, or my assistance is asked for.</p>

<p>I’m a natural leader by empowerment and I only become assertive when I determine its required. I work well in team environments due to my nature but being highly introverted, I will certainly let other lead and direct proceedings, unless I feel it will be detrimental to the group.</p>

<p>I have no Social Networking accounts to speak of where I post anything that can be attributed to me personally. Nor or do I ever more than rarely ever post anything on internet forums, so this course is something which will certainly challenge me at times.</p>

<p>Formation</p>
<p>As an employer, I re-iterate my original analysis. This is a quick tool that will give you an insight into a person's personality profile and associated traits, but by no means would this be a determining factor without more thorough testing and assessment.</p>

<p>To be more specific and to answer in relation to teamwork associated with this degree, I would try to establish a repour and gravitate toward like-minded individuals and people whose profiles work in harmony with my own.</P>

<p> saying this though, throughout my life I’ve developed an excellent sense of what successful teamwork is. I’ve routinely worked with personalities you could realistically attribute to the majority if not all the 16 distinct profiles identified by the Myers Briggs testing.</p>

<p>Utilising my experience derived from my military background to my current specialist role, often working in highly stressful and dangerous environments. I’ve learnt to associate and co-operate with prominent Alpha personality types to the extravagant and flamboyant.</p>

<p>As I stated, I do have a preference and I think this is the most comfortable environment for me personally, conducive for me/our team to achieve the best results possible.</p>
